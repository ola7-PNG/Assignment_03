    <h1>Fashion Industry Sales & Consumption Over Time</h1>

    <!-- Global Fashion Industry Sales Chart -->
    <p class="narration">
        The global fashion industry has evolved significantly over the last century. In the early 1900s, fashion was a luxury reserved for the wealthy, with limited mass production. However, by the mid-20th century, global demand began to rise thanks to innovations in manufacturing and the proliferation of ready-to-wear clothing. The growth truly exploded in the 1990s, driven by fast fashion and the rise of online shopping, propelling sales into the hundreds of billions. As of 2020, the fashion industry generates over $700 billion annually. This chart shows the sales trajectory from 1900 to 2020.

    <!-- Fast Fashion vs Luxury Fashion Sales Chart -->
    <p class="narration">
        In the 21st century, fast fashion has seen explosive growth, thanks to brands like H&M, Zara, and Shein that offer quick production cycles and affordable prices. Fast fashion's appeal lies in its ability to deliver trendy clothing at a fraction of the cost of luxury counterparts. While luxury fashion remains strong, with brands like Louis Vuitton and Gucci continuing to thrive, fast fashion has outpaced luxury in terms of overall market growth, with fast fashion sales projected to reach $700 billion by 2025.

This is reflected in the growing number of consumers who are willing to pay a premium for products made from sustainable materials.
